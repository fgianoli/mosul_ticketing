# How to Ask for Assistance: A Netiquette Guide

When asking for help, providing clear and detailed information is crucial. Follow these steps to ensure effective communication and a faster resolution:

## 1. Introduce the Problem
- Briefly describe what is happening.
- State the main issue in a single sentence, if possible.

**Example**:  
"I am unable to sync Sector 109."

## 2. Provide Context
- Specify the sector or application related to the problem:
  - Is it related to QGIS (Laptop) or MerginMaps (Tablet)?
  - Does it happen only to me or with other users also?

## 3. Describe the Problem in Detail
- What exactly happens? (e.g., errors, crashes, unexpected behavior).
- When does it occur? (e.g., during startup, while syncing).
- Is there an error message? Provide the full text or a screenshot.

## 4. List Any Troubleshooting Steps
- Explain what you have already tried to resolve the issue:
  - Reinstalling the app.
  - Deleting and redownloading the project.
  - Checking logs or error reports.
  - Testing on a different tablet.
  - Sending the error logs to support.

## 5. Ask Specific Questions
- Instead of asking *"The project is not working?"*, try:
  - *"Sector X doesnâ€™t synchronize due to this error 'Multiple GIS project files were found.' I already tried to redownload the project. How can I resolve this?"*

## 6. Always Give Feedback if the Problem is Solved
- If you have solved the problem, let us know how it was resolved.

### Example Request:
*"I am facing an issue with MerginMaps on my tablet while trying to sync a project. The app displays the error: 'Sync failed: Network connection timeout.' This issue occurs every time I try to synchronize a project larger than 50MB, even with a stable Wi-Fi connection.*

*I have tested syncing the same project on a desktop and another tablet, and it works without issues. I have tried the following steps to resolve the problem:*
- Restarting the tablet and app.
- Clearing the app cache and re-logging into MerginMaps.
- Testing with a smaller project, which syncs successfully.

*Despite these efforts, the problem persists only with this specific tablet. Can you help me identify what might be causing the issue or suggest further troubleshooting steps?"*
