### Example Request:
*"I am facing an issue with MerginMaps on my tablet while trying to sync a project. The app displays the error: 'Sync failed: Network connection timeout.' This issue occurs every time I try to synchronize a project larger than 50MB, even with a stable Wi-Fi connection.*  

*I have tested syncing the same project on a desktop and another tablet, and it works without issues. I have tried the following steps to resolve the problem:*  
- Restarting the tablet and app.  
- Clearing the app cache and re-logging into MerginMaps.  
- Testing with a smaller project, which syncs successfully.  

*Despite these efforts, the problem persists only with this specific tablet. Can you help me identify what might be causing the issue or suggest further troubleshooting steps?"*
